# HOW TO TRAIN MODEL

To train your model , follow the following steps : 

- Open a terminal in the `src` directory. Either open the command prompt in the directory or use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory.

- Open the `config.py` file and add your parameters to the config file. You could see the structure and parameters used in the config file from [here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/ConfigFile/)  

- Then run the `main.py` file by using the command `python main.py`.
